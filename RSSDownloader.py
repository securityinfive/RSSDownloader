Python script to download MP3 files from a podcast's RSS feed.
Usage:
   - Simply enter the URL for the RSS feed.
   - Enter a local directory where the mp3 files will download to.
   - Run and enter the number of files you want to download from the feed.
        - Specific number within the range of the episodes/files in the feed.
        - Enter 0 and it will download all the files in the feed.

I created this as I teach myself Python on the side. It started off as a simple downloader exercise and I grew
it into a tool for me to archive the 700+ episodes of my podcast from my host. I then expanded it to try
to be dynamic enough to work with any 'standard' RSS feed. Currently the RSS_Target and local_target_dir are hard coded.

Future ideas to change this to where it could be scheduled for regular local downloads outside podcast player services.
